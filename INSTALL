GCC bug
----------
Beware, GCC has a bug affecting propagation in CryptoMiniSat:

http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=47365

This seems to affect all gcc versions 4.5.x and is latent in
trunk of upcoming 4.6.0

-----------
Libraries needed
-----------
You will need the following libraries to compile the sources:
* libz

-----------------
Building the source
-----------------
CMake is needed to build the code. Install cmake then issue:

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ../
$ make -j8

CMake should work on Windows&Mac OS as well.

---------
Please read help
---------
For help, build the program, and issue:
'./cryptominisat -help'

--------------
Verbose debug
-------------
You can also turn on verbose debugging.
Simply remove the comment before 

"//#define VERBOSE_DEBUG" 
in Solver/constants.h and re-compile

When executing:

'./cryptominisat satfile.cnf'
You will see a LOT of debug info. You should therefore maybe do:

'./cryptominisat satfile.cnf > debuginfo.txt'
then you can open the 'debuginfo.txt' file from a text editor and have a look

--------------------------
Windows binary generation
-------------------------
It should be possible f you compile under windows
using Visual C++. Please read the HOWTO_VisualCpp for details

I compile under linux all windows binaries, using gcc that generates 
windows executables. It works really well. There is a sort-of-howto in 
the "HOWTO_MinGW32" text file. A short step-by-step is here: 

1) Install gcc that generates windows binaries:

i586-mingw32msvc

2) Install all libraries (libz) 

3) Get "libz" from source and compile as per "HOWTO_MINGW32"
