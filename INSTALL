GCC bug
----------
Beware, GCC has a bug affecting propagation in CryptoMiniSat:

http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=47365

This seems to affect all gcc versions 4.5.x and is latent in
trunk of upcoming 4.6.0

-----------
Libraries needed
-----------
You will need the following libraries to compile the sources:
* libz
* libboost
* libboost-program-options
* m4ri from GITHUB

-----------------
Building the source
-----------------
CMake is needed to build the code. Install cmake then issue:

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ../
$ make -j8

CMake should work on Windows&Mac OS as well.

---------
Please read help
---------
For help, build the program, and issue:
'./cryptominisat -h'

----------
Fuzzing
----------
You will need cnf-utils from github.com/msoos/ There, the XOR-to-CNF
converter is available that is needed for the fuzzer to run.

--------------------------
Windows binary generation
-------------------------

Not supported, but possible with cmake & boost installed
