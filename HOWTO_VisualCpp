If compiling with Visual C, the CHUNK_LIMIT poses problems.
Problem is, that VC2008 seems to have a too small default stack, which is not big enough.
With default command line parameters it will crash.
The workaround is to give the command line parameter /F. With this you can
increase the stack to a certain size. Setting it to 2 MB is good enough

ZLIB might also pose problems. If you cannot correctly compile it under
windows, I suggest you add the -DDISABLE_ZLIB to your compilation flags.

You also need BOOST for the moment to compile the program. This is due to Tarjan's
algorithm used to find strongly connected components

The compilation instruction should finally be:

cl /favor:INTEL64 /O2 /Fecryptominisat64.exe -DVERSION="__DATE__" -DDISABLE_ZLIB \
/F2097152 /TP /EHsc -I. -I../mtl/ -I../MTRand/ Main.cpp Solver.cpp \
