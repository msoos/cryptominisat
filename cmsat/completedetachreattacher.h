/**
@brief Helper class to completely detaches all(or only non-native) clauses

Used in classes that (may) do a lot of clause-changning, in which case
detaching&reattaching of clauses would be neccessary to do
individually, which is \b very slow

A main use-case is the following:
-# detach all clauses
-# play around with all clauses as desired. Cannot call solver.propagate() here
-# attach again
