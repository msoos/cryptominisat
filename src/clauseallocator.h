@brief Allocates memory for (xor) clauses

This class allocates memory in large chunks, then distributes it to clauses when
needed. When instructed, it consolidates the unused space (i.e. clauses free()-ed).
Essentially, it is a stack-like allocator for clauses. It is useful to have
this, because this way, we can address clauses according to their number,
which is 32-bit, instead of their address, which might be 64-bit
